# Gas Price Analysis Argentina (2019–2025)

## 📖 Project Description
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical analysis of natural gas prices in Argentina between 2019 and 2025 using Python.

**Academic project developed as part of the Programming 1 course.**

The analysis includes:
- Dataset exploration and cleaning
- Filtering data by basin (cuenca) and year
- Statistical analysis of different gas price types
- Time series visualization of price evolution
- Comparison between domestic and export prices

## 📊 Dataset
Source: Argentina Energy Secretariat (Secretaría de Energía)

File used: [precios-de-gas-natural-CLEANED.csv](precios-de-gas-natural-CLEANED.csv)

The dataset contains monthly natural gas price data for different production basins and price categories:
- GNC (vehicle gas)
- Power plants (usina)
- Industrial use
- Export prices

## 📈 Key Findings
- The Noroeste basin shows the highest historical industrial gas prices.
- A significant increase in power plant gas prices is observed between 2024 and 2025.
- Export gas prices tend to be higher than domestic prices.
- Price variations between 2021 and 2022 may be linked to global macroeconomic and energy market changes.
